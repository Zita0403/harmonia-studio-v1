This website is a **fictional cosmetic salon** demo project, created as **my first exam project** at the end of the first module of the **Full Stack Web Development Training** (HTML+CSS(+JavaScript basics) Front-End Development Course).

## Description

The aim of the exam was to create a **modern, responsive and semantically correct website** that includes several subpages and demonstrates my foundational knowledge of **HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript and jQuery**.
The website is optimized for **mobile, tablet and desktop** devices.
Responsiveness is achieved using **SASS media queries, mixins and flexible CSS layouts (Grid, Flexbox)**.
Both the HTML and CSS code were validated using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Structure

The website consists of the following pages:
- **index.html** - Home page, short introduction, main contents
- **facial-treatment.html** - Description of facial treatments
- **body-treatment.html** - Description of body treatments
- **facial-treatment.html** - Description of hair removal procedures
- **make-up.html** - Makeup services
- **price-list.html** - Price list in table format
- **booking.html** Appointment booking form

## Technologies used

- **HTML5** - Semantic page structure
- **CSS3** - SASS generated, responsive design (Grid, Flexbox, media queries)
- **SASS (SCSS)** - Modular and maintainable stylesheet with variables and mixins
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Interactive features and dynamic behavior
